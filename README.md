This research explores the varying levels of interaction fidelity by investigating how different levels of responsiveness and behavioural realism affect peopleâ€™s experience of interacting with virtual humans. This is accomplished through the creation of Cinemacraft, a technology-mediated immersive platform for collaborative human-computer interaction in a virtual 3d world and the incorporation of sensory fusion to improve the fidelity of the real time collaboration. It investigates  interaction techniques within the context of a multiplayer sandbox-voxel game engine and proposes how interaction qualities of the shared virtual 3d space  can be used to further involve a user as well as simultaneously offer a stimulating experience. The primary hypothesis of the study is that embodied interactions result in a higher degree of immersion and co-presence, and that sensory fusion can improve the quality of these interactions. The argument is developed through research justification, followed by a user-study to demonstrate the qualitative results and quantitative metrics.
